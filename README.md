### Word Occurence Assessment

#### Question 1
1. Please run the executable WorkOccurence.Console.exe file on Executable folder

#### Question 2

I have used asynchronous multithreading processing using Parrallel.ForEachAsync to speed up the processing. Rather than normal foreach which runs on only one thread at the time. This will also be more faster depending on the Machine Processors so which mean we can scale up for more resource to speed up processing. This can also be much faster if we use spark which is used for processing large volume of data. Please check below for more info about spark. Please also check for more info on Parrallel.ForEachAsync.
